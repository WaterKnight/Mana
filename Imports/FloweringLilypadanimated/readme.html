<br />
here you have a lilypad with a floating animation and the high def textures from one of the wc3 campaign glue screens (forgot which one XD).<br />
Use it for a small pond or lake, or a calm bend in a river. Works great in any cinematic or map, and takes virtually no space!!!<br />
<br />
Credits not required, thank blizzard for the original texture and base ;)<br />
Enjoy.<br />
